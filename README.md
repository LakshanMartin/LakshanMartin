# Personal Projects

## [Weekly Specials](https://github.com/LakshanMartin/Weekly_Specials) (Android App)

This project was inspired by my wife’s frustrations of having to switch between two phone browser tabs to view and compare prices of groceries through the Woolworths Supermarket and Coles Supermarket websites. 

I created an application to search and compare prices of items from Woolworths and Coles. I implemented the following functionality:

- Search for items (plus a toggle for items on specials)
- Create shopping lists
- Database to store shopping lists
- Email/SMS shopping list

I haven’t quite finalised this project, however it has all the functionality mentioned above and is used on a regular basis by my wife and a couple of her colleagues. 



## Cyber Security CTF Write-Ups (ongoing)

Aside from studying Software Engineering, I am also quite interested in Cyber Security. I enjoy working through “Capture the Flag” (CTF’s) games to learn a variety of skills not formally taught through my degree.

## Portfolio Website (work in progress)

I began this project as a way to learn JavaScript and the React library. I have expectations to utilise this website to host and better display my Project Portfolio.
